Q. categorize statements into two buckets: one for statements that align with MLOps principles and another for statements that do not.
1. Set up automated testing and validation pipelines for models before they reach production.
2. Implement version control for both data and model code to ensure reproducibility and traceability.
3. Establish a system for continuous monitoring of model performance in production.
4. Conduct a lengthy manual review process for every model update before deployment.
5. Rely on manual deployment processes for all model changes to maintain control.
6. Keep the data science and operations teams completely separate to avoid confusion.
